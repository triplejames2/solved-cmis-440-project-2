Using the hello2 servlet tutorial as an example, modify the code to provide a form that collects the first name, last name, email address and date of birth of a user. This tutorial is found in your glassfish installation [glassfish_home]docsjavaee-tutorialexampleswebservlet. The [glassfish_home] is the folder where you installed glassfish following the JavaEE7 Environment Setup document found in the Week1 content.

For the response, display all of the information provided by the user that was entered into the collection form.

Format the output data as follows:

Thanks for completing our Customer Survey form on [todayâ€™s date and time]! The data you entered was:

First name: [firstname]

Last name: [lastname]

Email address: [email address]

Birth date: [birthdate]

Note that you should use the current date and time as part of the output. So each time you run the application you will receive slightly different results.

You should use the Java API to look-up and determine how to extract the current date and time. An example output format for the date and time is: November 21, 2016 @12:15:30 PM. You can create your own unique format to display the date and time.
